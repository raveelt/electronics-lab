## Final Project

For the project, I made a accelerometer-controlled car. The components needed for the construction are as follows:

- Accelerometer (3-axis)
- Wireless Transmitter/Reciever (434 MHz)
- 8-bit Encoder/Decoder
- Motor Regulator
- Microcontroller (MSP430)

Exact details regarding the apparatus and individual component functions is described in the final report which can be found in the projects folder.
